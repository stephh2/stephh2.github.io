				<h1><b>About Me</b></h1>
				<p>
					<img id="ME" src="Photos/ME.JPG">
					I was born in Galesburg, IL on Thanksgiving of 1996 but by Christmas, my family and I had returned to our home in Montego Bay, Jamaica. We all lived in Jamaica until August of 2004, when my mom got a new job and we moved to Lexington, KY. Lexington was home for 11 years but in August of 2015 I moved to Blacksburg, VA to attend Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.

				<p>
					At Virginia Tech it is common for students to say proudly, "This is Home" and it honestly has become just that. I got involved in many different clubs, groups, and activities that created a family like culture around me. I have been a sister in my social sorority, Gamma Delta Sigma, for 3 years and have even held the position of External Philanthropy chair. I play on an Intramural Softball team and am proud member of the Society of Women in Engineering. If these activities don’t keep me too busy, I enjoy hiking the Appalachian Trail with friends and cheering on the Hokies in all sporting events.
				</p>
				<p>
					A hobby I hope to continue in my future is traveling. It could be around the US (probably going to MLB games), or around the world but I believe that traveling is one of the most important and underrated experiences in a person’s life. I enjoy seeing other cultures around the world and how they live, eat and explore differently than I do. So far, I have been to 15 countries across 4 continents and want to see even more. If given the opportunity, everyone should travel in their life.

				<h3>High School: <a href="https://www.fcps.net/Page/89">Paul Laurence Dunbar High School</a></h3>
				<p>
					My High School had about 2,200 students and had several different tracks of education for the goals of each individual student. I chose to follow the track that included 5 AP courses and 1 Dual Enrollment course. By graduation in May of 2015, I had earned a 4.0 GPA and accrued 17 college credits which would later allow me to graduate college in only 3 and a half years.

				<h3>College: <a href="https://vt.edu/">Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University</a></h3>
				<p>
					I am about to start my 4th year at Virginia Tech and am excited to graduate in December. I will graduate with my Bachelors of Science in Computer Engineering. I currently have a GPA of 3.6 and have been on the Dean's List 5 of my 6 completed semesters.

				<h3>Self-Education</h3>
		   		<p>
					Over the last year, I have been teaching myself different programming skills and languages though online courses offered by <a href="https://www.udemy.com">Udemy</a>. These courses include a Web Development and a React Native App Developement class. In this process, I have been able to teach myself how to create this website and soon make the apps I want that aren't available  to me.
